<h2>A demonstration of strength</h2>
Following the first Olympiads, the second Winter and Summer Olympiad was set to take place in Austria.
<h2>Remote, but dedicated</h2>
There are various reasons, why the small town of Mürzzuschlag with is barely 10.000 inhabitants was chosen to host a mass sporting event like the Olympiad.

<h2>The Linzer Programm</h2>
The so-called Linzer Programm was the key document which would define the key policies of the social democratic party and their clubs from its inception in 1926 to the prohibition of the party in 1934. It clearly acknowledges Marxism and class struggle as well as the necessity that socialism is a stepping stone for society to move from capitalism to communism. While it acknowledges the achievements of the first republic such as suffrages and social welfare, its militant tone was interpreted as proclamation of class war by political opponents. It proved disastrous for the social democratic party’s standing and groups like the Heimwehr, the Christian socialist party’s paramilitary wing, profited from gaining new members as a consequence (Austria Forum).
