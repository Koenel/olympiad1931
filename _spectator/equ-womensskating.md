        <p>Elfriede Gönner did not only win the couple’s figure skating with her partner Rudolf Lang, but also the women’s single competition, ahead of Lotte Ronay, Rodak and Hermine Adamek, who also competed for Austria. The Austrian success in men and women’s figure skating came quite as a surprise because the so-called Vienna school had only been training for one year. In men’s figure skating, Schlichtinger came first, ahead of competitors from Latvia and Germany. In the women’s competition, only Austrians participated (<span class="quote">Oesterreichische Arbeiter-Turn- und Sport-Zeitung</span>, 1931, p.16). Therefore this competition was <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Any internationally listed competition required competitors from at least three different nations.">not listed among international competitions</a>.</p>
        <p>Elfriede Gönner was an excellent speed skater too, and established a new record in 1932 when she complete the 1500m distance in 3:27:40 minutes, in her penultimate year as a competitor. In the picture, Gönner can be seen wearing a more modern attire that features shorter skirts than in the pre-war era and had been popularised by leading skating figures like Sonja Henie (<span class="quote">Tomlinson</span>, 2010).</p>

        <p>Prior to the ice-skating competitions that would take place on Friday, 6th February, the organisers worried about the weather conditions. While it had been snowing considerably more than expected, temperatures rose, so that the ice on the rink was in danger of melting and becoming too bumpy for the competitions. Luckily, the temperatures dropped overnight and all events could take place. Visitors did not have to commute to the alternative venue in <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mödling is on the same train line as Mürzzuschlag, but much closer to Vienna and could only provide ice rinks.">Mödling</a>, roughly 90km north-east of Mürzzuschlag. (<span class="quote">Das Kleine Blatt</span>, 6 Feb 1931, p.3).</p>
