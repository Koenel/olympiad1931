        <p>Elfriede Gönner did not only win the couple’s figure skating with her partner Rudolf Lang but also the women’s single, ahead of Austria’s, Lotte Ronay, Rodak and Hermine Adamek. The Austrian success in men and women’s figure skating came quite as a surprise because the so-called Vienna school had only been training for one year. In men’s figure skating, Schlichtinger came first, ahead of competitors from Latvia and Germany. In the women’s competition, only Austrians participated (Oesterreichische Arbeiter-Turn- und Sport-Zeitung, 1931, p.16). Therefore this competition was not listed among international competitions because it would have required competitors from at least three different nations.<p>
        <p>Elfriede Gönner was an excellent speed skater too, and established a new record in 1932 when she complete the 1500m distance in 3:27:40 minutes, in her <a href="http://www.speedskatingnews.info/skater/elfriede-goenner">penultimate year as a competitor</a>. In the picture, Gönner can be seen wearing a more modern attire that features shorter skirts than in the pre-war era and popularised by leading skating figures like Sonja Henie (Tomlinson, 2010).</p>

        <p>Prior to the ice-skating competitions that would take place on Friday, 6th February, the organisers started to worry about the weather conditions. While it had been snowing considerably more than expected, temperatures rose, so that the ice on the rink was in danger of melting and becoming too bumpy for the competitions. Luckily, the temperatures dropped overnight and all events could take place. Had they not dropped, the competitions would have be held in Mödling, roughly 90km north-east of Mürzzuschlag (Das Kleine Blatt, 6 Feb 1931, p.3).</p>
