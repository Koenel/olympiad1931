abstract: Evening entertainment was provided indoors and outdoors to share local culture and political messages. But joining indoors was for a privileged few.

    <p>Free outdoor events were open to everyone. One of the most notable was the so-called <a href="#" class="translation" data-toggle="tooltip" title="torch parade">Fackelzug</a>. As night fell, athletes and organisers joined a parade through the town on Saturday, February 7th, at 6pm. They were accompanied by three music bands and ended their walk at the ski jump Ganzsteinschanze, illuminating the area with torches (Hüttenegger, 1931, p.1). While the masses chanted socialist songs and paroles in chorus, fires were lit on the mountaintops across the valley, creating an impressive sight. On the following day, the last day of the Olympiad, the audience was entertained by special athletic performances of the figure skaters at the ice-skating rink and a final rally at the Ganzsteinschanze. </p>

    <p>Most people came for the sports, and there was sufficient space in brochures to note down the results of the competitions. Some people even placed bets on winning teams. If you had a ticket for the Olympiad, you could enjoy as many competitions as you wanted and watch your favourite athletes cross the finishing line.</p>
    <p>Visitors could join culturally interesting events in the evenings. However, only a fraction of the 8000 spectators (<span class="quote">Das Kleine Blatt</span>, 7 Feb 1931, p.6) was able to participate in these events that were mostly held indoors. Everyone who wanted to enjoy the concerts, acts and presentations needed tickets. Those who had an event pass could participate in one of the evening events, depending on capacity. This was included in the ticket price of 1.50 or 3.50 Shillings. The opening ceremony and the closing ceremony were invitation-only, and most spectators were, despite the democratic social democratic perspective, excluded from these events.</p>  
    <p>Nevertheless, the event programme was a showcase of the working class cultural efforts, ranging from concerts, to political cabaret and other art performances. Was it affordable for the general public? Please refer to the price list below!</p>
