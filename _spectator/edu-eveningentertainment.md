abstract: Tickets were reasonably priced but access was still limited. Those with connections or of higher social standing could enjoy more sophisticated evening entertainment than the masses.

        <p>Although the Linzer Programm clearly states that it fosters democracy and intends to work on the equality of those in the workforce, social standing still played a role in the participation of mass events such as the 1931 Workers’ Winter Olympiad. While everybody was allowed to <a href="https://workerswinterolympiad1931.netlify.app/spectator/clstr-samebutdifferent.html" class="link-info">purchase a ticket to the event</a> and train travel was subsidised to allow as many people as possible to come and overcome financial restrictions (Zotter, 1996, p.44), not everybody could partake in the evening events that took place indoors. Here, people in the public eye were priviledge to gain access, as the ticket below shows.</p>
        <div class="grid-item" id="exhibit-image"><img src="../media/IMG_20210624_113052.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="{{ page.image-descr2 }}"> {{ page.image-descr2 }}<a href="#" class="translation" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Municipal Office Mürzzuschlag, 29th January 1931. Legitimation for Mr Albert Knotz, retired teacher in Mürzzuschlag is, as a member of the Koburgerhaus-Club  entitled to enter the Koburger Haus and all its rooms at any time during the Olympiad, free of charge.

        <p>It is worthwhile noting, that not only Albert Knotz’ prestigious social status as head teacher is mentioned but also his membership of the <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The Koburgerhaus Club was a politically right wing organisation that favoured German nationalist politics"> Koburgerhaus Club</a> where many events were hosted during the Olympiad. The building, now demolished, provided one of the largest function rooms in Mürzzuschlag. From the ticket, it is not clear whether Knotz would only participate as a spectator or if he might have had other duties during the events. However, his profession does not mark him as a member of the working class but as somebody who could be sympathetic to their cause. At the time, Knotz was known as a strong youth supporter, irrespective of their background.</p>
        <p>Three venues were used on four consecutive days. Below, you can find a list of events and links to some of the music that was played on each night.</p>
