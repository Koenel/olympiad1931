        <p>While most people came for the sports, there was a need to create sufficient after-competition-events that would appeal to a culturally interested audience. However, only a fraction of the 8000 spectators (Das Kleine Blatt, 7 Feb 1931, p6) was able to participate in these events if they were held indoors. Everyone who wanted to enjoy the concerts, acts and presentations needed tickets. Those who had an event pass could participate in one of the evening events, depending on capacity. This was included in the ticket price of 1.50 or 3.50 Shillings. The opening ceremony and the closing ceremony were invitation-only.</p>
        <p>Three venues were used on four consecutive days. Below, you can find a list of events and links to some of the music that was played on each night.</p>

        <p>Free events were open to everyone. One of the most notable was the so-called Fackelzug (torch parade). As night fell, athletes and organisers moved in a parade through the town, ending their walk at the Ganzsteinschanze, illuminating the area with torches. Simultaneously, fires were light on the mountaintops across, creating an impressive sight. The following night, the audience was entertained by special athletic performances of the figure skaters at the ice-skating rink.</p>
