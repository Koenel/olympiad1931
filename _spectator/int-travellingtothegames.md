<p>Despite relatively high costs, an agreement with the national train service ÖBB allowed travellers to enjoy cheaper prices on their trains and other smaller train service providers (Arbeiterwille 1930, 4). Participants enjoyed 25% off regular ticket prices. This price reduction was applicable for two weeks: Any trip to Mürzzuschlag could start on February 1st the earliest and the destination had to be reached by February 8th 12pm the latest. The return trip could not be taken before February 5th 12pm and had to be completed by February 15th midnight, if the traveller’s destination was a stop in Austria (Festführer, 28). If one was travelling from abroad, booking tickets through a certified travel agency was recommended. Furthermore, young people who travelled in groups received 50% discount. The same was true for those who did not stay in Mürzzuschlag but wanted to travel from their quarters to the competition grounds every day. Reduced prices also required the passenger to show their valid spectator tickets (Festführer, 28).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Bundesbahnen did not seem too fond of the games. In a last minute decision, they allowed the train station to be decorated, but only in red-white-red (colours of the Austrian flag) and green-white (colours of Styria); red for the socialists was forbidden. Likewise, they did not allow the waiting area for second class passengers to be turned into a welcoming area for national and international guests. Following these decisions, the event committee decided to renounce decorating the train station altogether (Der Abend, 3rd February 1931, p6).</p>
<p>For competitors from abroad, it was particularly difficult to gather the financial means to join the event. For example, the German team did still not know how much financial support they could expect from the state to join the (Winter and Summer) Olympiads in January 1931. This marks the apparent disregard for workers’ sport because the bourgeoise Olympic committee had already received 50.000 RM (Reichsmark) for the Olympic Games in Los Angeles 1932, and was expecting another 100.000 Reichsmark to support gymnastics. To compare: a worker received an average monthly salary of 192 RM in 1931.
However, the situation was less dire in other countries. For example, the Finish workers team had received a generous lump sum of 300.000 Finnish mark to finance their enterprise.</p>
<p>The Hungarian team had boasted to send a delegation of 60 athletes, but only NUMBER could join the games in Mürzzuschlag, due to financial constraints. (all information Oesterreichische Arbeiter-Turn- und Sport_Zeitung January 1931, 10)
Clearly, next to taking time off work to join the games, many workers faced costs which they and their clubs could not defray. The need to rely on communal finance to participate restricted the clubs in sending their athletes to international events like the Olympiads in Mürzzuschlag and Vienna, ranging in costs for equipment to travel expenses.</p>
