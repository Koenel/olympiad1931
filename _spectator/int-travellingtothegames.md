        <p>Despite relatively high costs, an agreement with the national train service ÖBB allowed travellers to enjoy cheaper prices on their trains and other smaller train service providers (<span class="quote">Arbeiterwille</span> 1930, p. 4). Participants enjoyed 25% off regular ticket prices. This price reduction was applicable for two weeks: Any trip to Mürzzuschlag could start on February 1st the earliest and the destination had to be reached by February 8th 12pm the latest. The return trip could not be taken before February 5th 12pm and had to be completed by February 15th midnight, if the traveller’s destination was a stop in Austria (<span class="quote">Gastgeb</span> 1931, p. 28). If one was travelling from abroad, the organisers recommended booking tickets through a certified travel agency. Furthermore, young people who travelled in groups received 50% discount. The same was true for those who did not stay in Mürzzuschlag but wanted to travel from nearby areas to the competition grounds every day. Reduced prices also required passengers to show their valid spectator tickets (<span class="quote">Gastgeb</span> 1931, p. 28).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the Bundesbahnen were not fond of the games. In a last minute decision, they allowed the train station to be decorated, but only in red-white-red (colours of the Austrian flag) and green-white (colours of Styria); red for the socialists was forbidden. Likewise, they did not allow the waiting area for second class passengers to be turned into a welcoming area for national and international guests. Following these decisions, the event committee decided to renounce decorating the train station altogether (<span class="quote">Der Abend</span>, 3rd February 1931, p. 6).</p>

        <p>For competitors from abroad, it was particularly difficult to gather the financial means to join the event. For example, the German team did still not know how much financial support they could expect from the state to join the (Winter and Summer) Olympiads by January 1931. Apparently workers’ sports were largely ignored because by then the bourgeoise Olympic committee had already received 50.000 RM (Reichsmark) for the Olympic Games in Los Angeles 1932, and was expecting another <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The average worker earned 192RM a month">100.000 Reichsmark</a> to support gymnastics. </p>
        <p>The situation was less dire in other countries. For example, the Finish workers team had received a generous lump sum of 300.000 Finnish mark to finance their enterprise. Then again, the Hungarian team had boasted to send a delegation of 60 athletes, but only a few could join the games in Mürzzuschlag, due to financial constraints (<span class="quote">Oesterreichische Arbeiter-Turn- und Sport-Zeitung January</span> 1931, p. 10).
        Clearly, next to taking time off work to join the games, many workers faced costs which they and their clubs could not defray. The need to rely on communal finance to participate restricted the clubs in sending their athletes to international events like the Olympiads in Mürzzuschlag and Vienna, ranging in costs for <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Only few athlete could afford to take up expensive sports like skiing. Sports like running, swimming and gymnastics were much more common.">equipment</a> to travel expenses.</p>
