<p>Although the Linzer Programm clearly states that it fosters democracy and intends to work on the equality of those in the workforce, social standing still played a role in the participation of mass events such as the 1931 Workers’ Winter Olympiad. While everybody was allowed to purchase a ticket to the event and train travel was subsidised to allow as many people as possible to come and overcome financial restrictions (SOURCE), not everybody could partake in the evening events that took place indoors. Here, people in the public eye were priviledge to gain access, as the ticket below shows.
    It is worthwhile noting, that not only Albert Knotz’ prestigious social status as head teacher is mentioned but also his membership of the Koburgerhaus club where many events were hosted during the Olympiad. The building, now demolished, provided one of the largest function rooms in Mürzzuschlag. From the ticket, it is not clear whether Knotz would only participate as a spectator or if he might have had another duty during the events. However, his profession does not mark him as a member of the working class but as somebody who could be sympathetic to their course. However, the available material does not provide any further clues to Knotz’ opinion on the working class efforts.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, the event programme was a showcase of the working class cultural efforts, ranging from concerts, to political cabaret and other art performances.</p>
