    <p>Athletes and spectators were able to book rooms and beds in and around Mürzzuschlag for a fixed price of 3.50 Schillings from February 5th to February 8th. The rooms were allocated centrally and were paid in advance. For every further night, lodgers had to play 1 Schilling, again centrally organised. For hotels, visitors had to expect higher prices and they had to organise arrangements outside the Olympiad themselves (Festführer, 19).</p>
    <p>Finding lodgings for everybody proved difficult: first, Mürzzuschlag was expected to host between 15.000 and 16.000 people, almost double its population.  Therefore, the organisers asked the population in the surrounding villages to offer their homes and visitors were advised to book a place to stay before Dec 20, 1930 (Zotter, 45). Those who had not booked in advance could try their luck at the “Wohnungsaussschuß” (lodging committee) and hope that there was still a spot (Festführer, 19).</p> 
    <p>In addition, simple mass quarters, where athletes slept on straw and rough woollen blankets were arranged in the Mürzzuschlag’s school which were forced to close during the Olympiad (Zotter, 45,46, Der Abend 3rd February 1931, p6). 
    The masses had to be fed. Again, the organisers resorted to a centralised arrangement that offered coupons for lunch and dinner at designated pubs and restaurants. Lunch cost 3 Schillings, dinner 2 Schillings. Again, organisation was key and interested parties had to sign up at least one day in advance (Festführer, 19).</p>
