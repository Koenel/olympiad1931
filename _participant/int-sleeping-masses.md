abstract: In a town of 8000 people, it was difficult to find a place to sleep for everyone. Locals were asked to open their homes when other options failed.

    <p>Athletes and spectators were able to book rooms and beds in and around Mürzzuschlag for a fixed price of 3.50 Schillings from February 5th to February 8th. The rooms were <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The so-called 'Festbüro' was responsible for coordinating athletes and spectators">allocated centrally</a> and were paid in advance. For every further night, lodgers had to play 1 Schilling, again centrally organised. For hotels, visitors had to expect higher prices and they had to organise arrangements outside the Olympiad themselves (Festführer, 1931, p.19).</p>
    <p>Finding lodgings for everybody proved difficult: first, Mürzzuschlag was expected to host between 15.000 and 16.000 people, almost double its population. Therefore, the organisers asked the population in the surrounding villages to offer their homes and visitors were advised to book a place to stay before Dec 20, 1930 (Zotter, 1996, p.45). Those who had not booked in advance could try their luck at the <a href="#" class="translation" data-toggle="tooltip" title="lodging committee">Wohnungsaussschuß</a> and hope that there was still a spot (Gastgeb, 1931, p.19).</p> 
    <p>Initially, the national rail services had promised to provide sleeper train carriages to host visitors but <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The organisers considered this move an act of sabotage by the conservative government.">they backed out at short notice</a> (Der Abend, 1931, p.6). Therefore, simple mass quarters, where athletes slept on straw and rough woollen blankets were arranged in the school building. The school was closed during the Olympiad (Zotter, 1996, pp.45-46; Der Abend 3rd February 1931, p.6). 
    The masses had to be fed, too. Again, the organisers resorted to a centralised arrangement that offered coupons for lunch and dinner at designated pubs and restaurants. Lunch cost 3 Schillings, dinner 2 Schillings. Again, organisation was key and interested parties had to sign up at least one day in advance (Festführer, 1931, p.19).</p>
