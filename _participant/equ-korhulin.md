    <p>Even though they were outnumbered by male athletes, some of the female competitors were incredibly popular with fellow athletes and the crowds. Particularly the Finnish women’s team was popular. Impi Latinen and  Ester Korholin, who came second in the 4km women’s skiing race, just 11 seconds slower than fellow Finnish athlete Impi Latinen, finishing at 13:01 minutes. Latinen, who came first both in the 4km and the 6km race, was the daughter of racer Kalevi Latinen and had started her career as early as 14. In Mürzzuschlag, aged 22, she had already been racing professionally for more than 5 years.</p>
    <p>Following her two victories, a reporter of the conservative paper Kronen Zeitung attempted to conduct an interview with the skier. However, due to his lack of Finnish, the reporter had to resort to pantomime to elicit some information about Latinen. With some effort, he was able to find out that she was married and had been skiing from a very young age. Adding that the Finnish ladies would cook for themselves and eat porridge in their quarters during the Olympiad and that Latinen was an avid seamstress, the elicited information seemed sufficient to please the general tone and outlook of the article (Kronen Zeitung 8 February 1931, p7).</p>
    <p>Ester Korholin was considered the favourite to win the 4k race on Friday, 6th February 1931, and her victory fulfilled people’s expectations. The children’s sledge race took place at the same time (Das Kleine Blatt, 6 Feb 1931, p. 14).</p>
