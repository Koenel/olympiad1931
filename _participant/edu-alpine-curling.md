<div class="text-info">
<p>The 1931 Winter Olympiad provided athletes and spectators with the chance to engage with local traditions and get to know their hosting area. Therefore, the international athletes were joined by local teams who competed in a local sport called “Eisschießen”, Alpine curling.</p>

<p>Players or teams compete against each other, playing on an iced surface with a wooden device. The wooden device, the “Eisstock”, is a round wooden board, lined with a iron ring and mounted on a lathed wooden stick. Player hold it at the stick an push it across the ice and try to hit a goal. Turl Hüttenegger described two variants of the sport for the Oesterreichische Arbeiter-Turn- und Sport-Zeitung (January 1931). the first one is similar to bowling: individual players try to hit a target and accumulate points by aim as close as possible to the target. The player who has gained most points wins. The more popular team variant sees player aiming at a small wooden target, the “dove” (Taube) in the middle of the iced surface. Each team tries to bring their “Eisstöcke” as close as possible to the target and the closest team wins. However, as part of the game, on should not only try to be as close as possible but also push away the opponents’ stocks. This way, the game bears some similarity to bocce.</p>
KNÖDELSCHIEßEN?
<p>A friendly game between the international athletes was planned for the last day of the Olympiad to showcase the sport and enjoy each other’s company. However, Hüttenegger notes that not everybody is benevolent towards the tradition, as it can become ruthless and full of banter, including gambling for money and excessive drinking (Hüttenegger, p4,5). In contrast to this exuberance, the socialist movement frowned upon excessiveness, particularly in drinking, smoking and other excessive behaviour as something that is not worthy of the educated member of the working-class because “Arbeitersportler halten bei ihren Veranstaltungen Ordnung und Disziplin (Festführer, p19).
This tradition to compete in non-international sports can still be found today, for example Karate in the 2021 summer Olympics in Tokyo.</p>
