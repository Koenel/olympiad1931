<p>Class struggle from a working-class perspective is the struggle against the ruling bourgeoisie. The working class intends to overthrow the ruling bourgeoise class and utilise the tools of democracy to rule the republic. However, the Linzer Programm states that the bourgeoisie will not voluntarily give up their power but that the working class will have to fight and needs to convince the petty bourgeois as well as smallholders and traders to fight alongside the working class, if need be by using force rather than just peaceful measures (Linzer programm, III. Der Kampf um die Staatsmacht). Shortly after the end of WWI in 1918, local paramilitary groups had been established which were subsequently subsumed under the Heimwehr, closely linked to the Christian Socialist Party and supported by industrial magnates and Italian faschists. This way, they became a more anti-democratic force (Das Rote Wien). As a response, the social democratic party founded the Republikanischer Schutzbund in 1924 that should defend the achievements of the republic for the working class.
This workers’ paramilitary organisation, Republikanischer Schutzbund was led by Julius Deutsch and in the late 1920s, they had around 80.000 members whose initial goal was to ensure safety and order at working class events (Das Rote Wien). However, frequent clashes between Republikanischer Schutzbund and Heimwehr had led to streets fights and even deaths (Geschichtewiki). Its forces dwindled in the early 1930 and the Dollfuß regime eventually banned the Republikanischer Schutzbund in 1933.</p> 
<p>In 1931, the civil war was yet three years away, and the Republikanischer Schutzbund was still strong in industrial centres like Mürzzuschlag. It is therefore not surprising that the Republikanischer Schutzbund was present at the Worker’s Winter Olympiad in Mürzzuschlag. However, as can be seen in the picture, they did not only provide safety and order at the events. Members perform a flourish of trumpets ahead of the ski jump, marking the beginning of the event and their presence shows that the political component of the Olympiad. Their leader, Julius Deutsch, visited the event as an honorary guest and held numerous speeches to motivate the workers.</p>
