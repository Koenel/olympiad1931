Overall, the Olympiad could be considered a success for the socialist movement, showcasing their international solidarity, Austria’s hospitality and sporting integrity. However, the Olympiad was overshadowed by Otto Schwarz’ accident which proved to showcase the working classes communal support. Schwarz, an athlete from Aussig (now Ústí nad Labem, Czechoslovakia), participated in the 30km race. Josef Fischer’s eyewitness account “Im Kampf mit Schnee und Sturm” (Fighting against snow and storm) shows the weather conditions on Friday made it almost impossible to realise the race. Teams who prepared the slopes and laid the telephone cables struggled with masses of new snow that impeded their progress throughout the day. Fischer, one of the team leaders, recounts that the ascend to the mountain hut where the skiers would sleep the night before the race, took three hours because they had to bring red and blue flags to mark the slopes the next morning. On Friday morning, Fischer considered foregoing the first half kilometre because cornices obstructed the race course. Still, the teams completed their signposting, slope preparations and telephone lines in the early hours of Saturday morning.
Shortly after the start, Finnish skiers were seen to return to the hut, unwilling and unable to complete the race because there had been too much fresh snow.  Conditions were much better after the first kilometre, but many had to give up before making it to kilometre 29. For Schwarz, the race would find a lethal end at that mark: Two other athletes from Ternitz, Austria, whose skis had broken, were on their way back to the hut on foot, when they found Schwarz unconscious in the deep snow.  They were able to alert Fischer’s team at the hut and although a large number of volunteers and paramedics did their best to rescue Schwarz, it took them three hours to bring injured athlete into the valley from where he was taken to the hospital in Mürzzuschlag by an ambulance. How the accident happened, was a mystery to Fischer who considered the location unremarkable: “Der Unfall Schwarz’ ist an einer ganz harmlosen Stelle geschehen, wo wir nie daran dachten, daß dort etwas passieren könnte. Genau beim Kilometer 29, Ende der Schußfahrt, befindet sich ein zirka drei Meter breites Gatter, durch das die Laufstrecke führt. Und dieses Gatter muß Schwarz im Schneesturm verfehlt haben oder er hatte die Herrschaft für die Brettel überhaupt verloren. Es kann ihn auch beim Uebergang vom Schuß ins Flache, was ungefähr vor dem Gatter zutrifft, ausgehoben haben, so daß er mit voller Geschwindigkeit in den Zaun hineinfuhr. Gesehen hat es niemand. Der nächste Posten stand etwas weiter vorne und konnte im Schneesturm nichts bemerken, da man manchmal auf 20 Meter nichts mehr unterscheiden konnte.“ (Oesterreichische Arbeiter-Turn- und Sport-Zeitung, March 1931, 29)
Otto Schwarz, who suffered from various injuries including frostbite at his feet from the transport, died shortly after the accident in hospital. His parents showed particular gratitude to the support they received from local organisations when they arrived in Mürzzuschlag to transport their son back to Aussig. The organisers support showed a solidarity with strangers who were connected by their common values and goals as part of the international socialist and working-class movement.
