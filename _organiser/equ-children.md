        <p>During the Workers' Winter Olympiad, children had the chance to participate too. The organisers had organised a dedicated children’s sledge race that attracted youngsters from nearby and proud parents as well as curious spectators. Peter Ganster (aged 13), sporting number 9, won the children’s 1k race (<span class="source">Der Abend</span> 9 Feb 1931, p. 10). As Julius Deutsch had already stated in the <span class="source">Festführer</span>, the workers' movement focused strongly on fostering the youth and a large part of their resistance and success was due to their strong, dedicated young generation (Deutsch, 1931, p. 5). While this race provided a chance for the local youth to show their talents which otherwise would have been unknown to an international audience, creating a dedicated youth event can also be politically motivated. Not only because of lower birth rates following the war years 1914-1918, but also because of the rise of fascism, there was a need to attract young people to passionately join the workers' sports.</p>

        <p>Franz Czerny notes in his <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The article was featured in the Austrian workers gymnastics and sports newspaper, Österreichische Arbeiter Turn- und Sport-Zeitung">article</a> <span class="source"><a href="#" class="translation" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The youth question">Zur Jugendfrage</a></span> that many potential members of working-class youth clubs tend to choose the German national training groups which are located in bigger cities, particularly if they come from a <a href="#" class="translation" data-toggle="tooltip" title="a job that require more thinking than physical strength">“Intelligenzberuf”</a> working class background. These youngsters choose to continue their education at a commercial college instead of starting an apprenticeship locally. Other groups of teenagers and children are deemed too unruly because of their poor upbringing or too lazy to be attracted to more rigid sports clubs. Either way, Czerny points out that binding the young to club can guarantee votes in elections in the years to come (1931, p.39) because the young people are socialised in a socialist value system.</p>
