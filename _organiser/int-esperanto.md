One of the essential factors of working together with international groups was the use of a common language. The organisers of the Winter Olympiad relied on using Esperanto, a planned language that was created and publicised by Ludwig Zamenhof, a Polish doctor, in 1887.

Robert Diez deemed Esperanto the “Sprache des internationalen Proletariats” (language of the international proletariat), and considered learning the language as the only realistic option to communicate across language boundaries. He encouraged his fellow workers to learn Esperanto and join another 10.000 speakers across 37 nations in their efforts that would also make the second workers’ Winter Olympiad a success (Diez, 9). As Esperanto and its open, transnational ideology had become popular before WW1 and in the 1920s, the organisers could hope to find sufficient users of the language to use it as their lingua franca between the eight national teams that competed in the Olympiad.
It is unclear which role the language played during the actual event, but it was effectively present on the official poster of the Olympiad and in the Festführer, where Julius’ Deutsch welcoming words had been translated for a non-German speaking audience:
