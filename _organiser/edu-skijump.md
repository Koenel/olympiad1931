image-descr: A so-called Libelle was used to measure the angle of ascend and descent. Aligning the wooden beams was labourious and required a lot of accuracy.

image-descr2: The beams needed to be levelled and cut in the correct angles. Hüttenegger's team used a clinometer to ensure the accuracy of their work.

        <p>Sharing knowledge and educating the working class was one of the vital components of the social democratic cause. <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Austrian politician and leading theoretical thinker of the social democrats. He was highly influential in designing the Linzer Programm">Otto Bauer</a> and his followers believed that the working class needed to educate themselves in science and arts to create their own take on culture, an alternative to the bourgeoise. Mediums like their own newspapers served as an outlet to share and increase knowledge among the working class.</p>
        <p>Theodor "Thurl" Hüttenegger, local organiser of the Winter Olympics, was a passionate winter sport advocate and keen to elaborate on the details and requirements that made the event possible. Therefore, he wrote two in-depth articles on the calculations and requirements of building a ski jump. This way, he could share his experience and expertise with other clubs in Austria through one of their magazines, the <span class="source"><a href="#" class="translation" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Austrian workers gymnastics and sports newspaper">Oesterreichische Arbeiter-Turn- und Sport-Zeitung</a></span>.</p>
        <h2>How to build a ski jump</h2>

        <p> Back in the early 1930s, Hüttenegger and his team aimed to build a ski jump that would allow athletes to jump a distance of 40 metres. So, at a height of 60 metres, and a declension of 25 to 30 degrees, it is possible to build an adequate ski jump. However, the length needs to be four times the distance that athletes should be able to jump. Another issue is the terrain, an arboreous area was difficult to use, as the ski jump needed to be as straight as possible and trees obstructed the complex measuring process. In Mürzzuschlag, Hüttenegger and his team started to build their ski jump at Ganzstein. There had already been a less professional ski jump at that site but the team upgraded it to international standards. The team worked tirelessly throughout summer to complete their work before the cold weather complicated their enterprise.</p>
        <p>The building process did not only require precision, but also the use of approprieate measuring instruments like <a href="#" class="link-info" data-toggle="tooltip" title="it was used to measure the angles of the slope">clinometers</a> and spirit levels. This manual process was tedious and required frequent readjustments to ensure that the volunteers' work was not in vain. </p>
