                <p>Sharing knowledge and educating the working class was one of the vital components of the social democratic cause. Bauer and his followers believed that the working class needed to educate themselves in science and arts to create their own take on culture, an alternative to the bourgeoise.</p>
                <p>Thurl Hüttenegger, local organiser of the Winter Olympiad, was a passionate winter sport advocate and keen to elaborate on the details and requirements that made the event possible. Therefore, he wrote two in-depth articles on the calculations and requirements of building a ski jump. This way, he could share his experience and expertise with other clubs in Austria through one of their magazines, the Oesterreichische Arbeiter-Turn- und Sport-Zeitung.</p>

        <h2>How to build ski jump</h2>

                <p> Back in the early 1930s, Hüttenegger and his team aimed to build a ski jump that would allow athletes to jump a distance of 40 metres. So, at a height of 60 metres, and a declension of 25 to 30 degrees, it is possible to build an adequate ski jump. However, the length needs to be four times the distance that athletes should be able to jump. Another issue is the terrain, an arboreous area was difficult to use, as the ski jump needed to be as straight as possible and trees obstructed the complex measuring process.</p>
                <p>The building process did not only require precision, but also the use of approprieate measuring instruments like clinometers and spirit levels. This manual process was tedious and required frequent readjustments to ensure that the volunteers' work was not in vain. </p>
