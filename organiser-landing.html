<h1>Welcome to the organiser collection!</h1>
<p><span class="information">An event like the Second Workers' Winter Olympics require a solid organisation and a reliable team. Theodor H端ttenegger was a key figure in the organisation team of the events in M端rzzuschlag. H端ttenegger organised volunteering activities such as building the ski jump before the games, and he was responsible for organising ... during the event. Later in life, he founded the Winter!Sport!Museum! in M端rzzuschlag. In the picture, you can see him standing with other organisers and judges on the jury stand at the ski jump.</span></p>
