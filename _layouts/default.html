<!--why does this link href not work? Answer after trying: The include head overruns the home.css because it's given there-->
        <link href="../assets/home.css" rel="stylesheet">
<!--the meta tag ensures that the website content is scaled to device width-->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

{% include head.html %}

{{ content }}

{% include navigation.html %}

{% include footer.html %}
