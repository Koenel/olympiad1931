                <p class="intro-text">In this virtual exhibition, you will get to know the <b>Second Worker's Winter Olympiad</b>, held in <b>Mürzzuschlag</b> (Austria) in <b>1931</b>. This project aims to help you understand the utilisation of a mass sport event for the socialist politics of the period between the World Wars in the early 1930s.</p>
                <h2 class="home2">What is a Workers' Olympiad?</h2>
                <p class="intro-text">The Workers' Olympiads or Workers' Olympic Games were mass sport events organised by the SASI (Sozialistische Arbeiter-Sport Internationale, Socialist Workers' Sport International) and supported the international workers' movement, uniting them through sports. They were a countermovement to the famous Olympic Games that Pierre de Coubertin revived in 1894. The Workers' Olympiads were held three times: 1925 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, 1931 in Mürzzuschlag and Vienna, Austria, and 1937 in Antwerp, Belgium. A forth Olymmpiad in Helsinki, Finland, could not take place because of WW2.</p>
                <h2 class="home2">Why is it called an Olympiad?</h2>
                <p class="intro-text">Usually, an Olympiad is the intervall between two Olympic Games, and officially, the Workers' Olympiads are also called the Workers' Olympic Games. But in the materials that were produced for the Second Workers' Olympiad, the event is always called an Olympiad.</p>
