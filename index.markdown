This project aims to help you understand the utilisation of a mass sport event for the socialist politics of the period between the world wars in the early 1930s.</p>
    <h2 class="homeh2">Instructions</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">On the following pages, you can find digital exhibits that relate to five areas that socialist politics focused on: class struggle, education, equality, solidarity and an international outlook. You can either follow the viewpoint of somebody who attended the Olympiad, or, you can explore the exhibition by political topic.</p>
